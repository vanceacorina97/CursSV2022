# ChatBox - how wrote the message
The feature that I implemented is related to ChatBox history.
The scope of the feature is to print the player's name ('You' and 'Opponent') who has sent the message.
The purpose is to have a log of the messages' history.
I have kept these labels ('You' and 'Opponent') as only two players play the game and the identity of the players is not relevant to the game's rules.
